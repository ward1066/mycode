         <h1>Business Requirements</h1>
         		  
         <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
         		      
         <p>
            		          <span class="customer">ACME Plc.</span> has operated in the retail space for over thirty years supplying goods to customers via mail or telephone.
            		          With the advent of the internet <span class="customer">ACME Plc.</span> quickly realised that they would have to provide an internet based sales
            		          channel in order to maintain their market position. 
         </p>
         		      
         <p>
            		          In 2002 <span class="customer">ACME Plc.</span> embarked on a project to build a web channel for their services - they did this with their in-house IT department.
            		          Whilst this solution provided <span class="customer">ACME Plc.</span> with a web sales channel it had several shortcomings: 
            <ol>
               		              
               <li>It did not integrate with the backoffice system. 
                  <ul>
                     			                  
                     <li>It did not allow users to track orders.</li>
                     			                  
                     <li>Manual effort was spent re-keying orders into the back office system.</li>
                     			                  
                     <li>Manual effort is expended by <span class="customer">ACME Plc.</span> answering customer queries about their order status.
                     </li>
                     			              
                  </ul>
                  		              
               </li>
               		              
               <li>Users could not create an account and had to re-type invoice/delivery address details etc. every time they visited.</li>
               		              
               <li>Usability issues were reported by end users.</li>
               		              
               <li>It is now quite dated an does not take advantage of lastest developments in technology.</li>
               		          
            </ol>
            		      
         </p>
         		      
         <p>
            		          Recently <span class="customer">ACME Plc.</span> has been losing market share to some of its competitors who have a more streamlined internet sales operation. 
         </p>
         		   
         		  
         <h2 id="business-opportunity">Business Opportunity</h2>
         		      
         <p>
            		          <span class="customer">ACME Plc.</span> realise that they need to invest in their online sales channel or face a further decline in their market share. They
            		          view a revamped online offering that integrates with the backend CRM not only as an opportunity to improve their
            online presence and thus improve sales,
            		          but also as a way of reducing internal costs such that they can offer goods and services at more competitive prices.
            Additionally - should they regain market share - they
            		          will be in a better negotiating position with suppliers such that they can further improve their margin. 
         </p>
         		   
         		  
         <h2 id="business-objectives">Business Objectives and Success Criteria</h2>
         
         <ul class="requirements-list-title-only"></ul>
          
         
         <h2 id="needs">Customer/Market Needs</h2>
         
         <p>The online retail market is now fairly mature. There is an expectation that: 
            <ul>
               
               <li>User's can add, remove save one or more items in a shopping cart.</li>
               
               <li>Save some items for another visit.</li>
               
               <li>Recommend item's to a friend or add them to a wish list.</li>
               
               <li>Be able to review the status of current and historical orders.</li>
               
               <li>Be able to review the products and the merchants.</li>
               
            </ul>
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Additionally purchase to pay supply chains are typically electronic with suppliers being able to recieve, process, dispatch
            and invoice electronically. These functions should operate
            seemlessly with <span class="customer">ACME Plc.</span>'s CRM system that interfaces with <span class="project">ACME Online</span>. 
         </p>
          
         
         <h2 id="risks">Business Risks</h2>
         
         <p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>There is a risk that the adverse publicity of the existing system will mean that it is difficult to attract new users to the
                  online store resulting in a further reduction in market share and the possibility that some suppliers will terminate their
                  contract with <span class="customer">ACME Plc.</span>.
               </li>
               
               <li>There is a risk that mechants/suppliers will prefer to use the existing (human) channels to track orders resulting in no cost
                  benefit from the new system.
               </li>
               
               <li>There is a risk that poor integration between the <span class="project">ACME Online</span> solution and the existing CRM system could cause issues that affect all sales channels - not just those made online.
               </li>
               
               <li>There is a risk that staff currently performing re-keying and supplier managment roles may not want to be retrained for other
                  roles resulting in discontentment and (worst case) legal proceedings.
               </li>
               
            </ol>
