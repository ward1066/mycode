                        such that it is possible to lose one of the adapter servers without leaving any of the application request queues unserviced
                        (i.e. no consumer processing messages from the queue).  This is restricted within a site, i.e. LiveA and LiveB, such that
                        if all of the adapter facility was lost in one site, then the application request queues would cease to be serviced. The purpose
                        of this CCN is to propose the configuration of additional, dormant adapter instances on both LiveA and LiveB, solely to use
                        in the event of the loss of the whole adapter facility within a site.  A new instance for each of the applications (PDS, ACF,
                        LRS) will be configured. By default they will not be active. They will be configured such that the queue destinations that
                        they will consume from are those made available by the broker on the opposite site, e.g. in LiveA, they will be configured
                        to point at the LiveB queue manager cluster and vice versa.  In the event of a problem, these instances could be started (selectively)
                        with the sole purpose of clearing down the queues on the site experiencing the problem. They would be expected to be active
                        long enough for the queues to be fully emptied, on the assumption that part of the problem attack would be to suspend the
                        top-end services such that the affected messaging channels are routed to the fully operational site.  It has been suggested
                        that there are no design issues with this proposed solution. It remains to be understood whether or not there are any infrastructural
                        or network design issues with the proposed solution.

                        delivered as part of User Identity Management.  This presents us the Authority with a series problem come May 2007, due to
                        the volume of users whose certificates will expire.  <br><br>The Smartcard Service Centre, which is included within 2006B-2, was originally developed with an option for users to self
                        renew their Smartcard certificates.  Without the ability to self renew certificates a user?s Smartcard would not work and
                        would necessitate (as a minimum) a visit to their RA Manager/Agent.  Similarly, even if a user was given notification that
                        their certificates would expire in a set future period, the user would still need to visit their local RA Manager/Agent. 
                        The optimum solution is to allow them, security permitting, to renew the certificates on their Smartcard at a convenient time
                        for them pre-certificate expiry date.<br><br>Given the extent of the issue that the Authority will have in May, the feasibility of using the originally option of the Smartcard
                        Service Centre needs to be revisited to enable the facility of self certificate renew.

                        The design for storage in 10gR2 is based around a Tiered storage approach, utilising Tier 1 and 4 (as proposed for the MSS
                        technology refresh). This design is not dependent on the 'MSS' - it is the correct design regardless of the commercial model.<br>The expectation is that this new storage will replace the existing legacy storage in Live. Infrastructure migration will occur
                        when the new 10gR2 databases are built on the new storage. Both new and old storage will be presented to the database servers.
                        Once the Oracle 10gR2 migration steps (a separate project/piece of work out of scope for this CCN) are completed the old storage
                        can be unmounted from these database servers. The proposed storage infrastructure is in addition to the existing 'legacy'
                        storage and is unlikely result in a reduction in the Environmental footprint of Live storage. <br>Once all Live data has been migrated, the legacy 9980 storage would be free to be reused elsewhere in Spine if it is appropriate
                        to do so.<br>SUS will be moving to its own storage as part of the 10gR2 migration and this provision is already covered by CCN 1289. The
                        SAN switches in Live A will be shared between the new SUS storage and the new Live Storage requested in this CCN. Therefore
                        new switches are only needed in Live B (covered by this CCN).<br>Please see attached slides below for example drawings of the Live solutions plus an idea of the infrastructure migration work.

                        2006-B2 release is due to be in production use for longer than originally planned during which volumetrics are expected to
                        rise enormously. Without the ability to monitor inside the Java virtual machine NSOC are prevented from effectively proactively
                        managing the release.<br>The ability to collect and expose JVM statistics via the asadmin utility and JMX is available out of the box in Sun One Application
                        Server 8.1 but disabled by default.  We need it enabling within the SOE.<br>The key metrics that we are interested in are:<br>?	JVM Utilisation / Status Information<br>?	Current and maximum heap size<br>?	Committed Memory<br>?	Garbage Collection status<br>?	Thread Usage<br>?	Classes loaded<br>?	MBean Information<br>?	Servlet Status<br>?	Pool Status and Utilisation (MDB, JDBC, EJB, thread pools etc.)<br>?	Resource Utilisation<br>For each of the category of statistic it is possible to configure a detail level. As a minimum the detail level should be
                        configured as low.<br><br>The command line asadmin utility will be used to poll the application server for statistics. The existing Halcyon PrimeAlert
                        module for Sun Application server should be deployed to enable alerting against thresholds through integration with Sun Management
                        Center.<br><br>The configuration will be enhanced for the 2007-A release through the introduction of the HP toolset.

                        by a number of Spine Directorates.  This has been driven by a number of factors.  Firstly that 2007A is likely to be later
                        than expected, and hence volumes will be greater than expected when it is delivered.  Secondly, experience with the live service
                        has indicated a number of highly problematic aspects of the Spine solution (manifested in SLA penalties, and mean-time-to-repair

                        to carry out the transition.<br>(1) For the deployment of the EPR Application, scripts are required to pre-populate the EPR Oracle Database with reference
                        data. This reference data includes the following:<br>?	Message Definitions - Services, Interactions and Contract Properties that Spine supports<br>?	Message Sets - Groups of Message Definitions<br>?	Manufacturing Organisations and their software Products<br>There are three sources for this reference data:<br>?	4258 SDS Message Definitions and Sets.xls (BT Document - for Services, Interactions and Contract Properties)<br>?	EPR_MigrationData_Requirements.xls (NHS CfH Document - for Manufacturers and Products)<br>?	2087 - EIS.doc (BT Document - for ACF Characteristics)<br><br>(2) Prior to the deployment of the EPR Application, scripts are also required for the data transition of existing End-Point
                        Systems in SDS.<br>To allow the existing End-Point Systems in SDS to be managed by the EPR Application, their configurations in SDS have to meet
                        the data requirements for the EPR Application. These data requirements for the EPR Application are based on a set of Services,
                        Interactions and Contract Properties (Message Definitions) being grouped together into Message Sets. These Message Sets are
                        then associated to Manufacturers? software Products. The Products are then associated to End-Point Systems in SDS.<br>All new End-Point Systems created through the EPR Application will be based upon these data requirements. The transition requires
                        scripts to analyse and update existing End-Point Systems in SDS to reflect these data requirements.<br><br>* * * * *<br><br>The scripts required for the above two changes should allow the following:<br>?	Seamless operation against any environment<br>?	Data sources in a fixed format<br>?	Changes to the content of the data sources

                        implied environmental changes, needed to replace Oracle OLAP with MAS and facilitate a satisfactory EDQRS reporting service

                        Despite functioning to spec in BT test environments, this feature has, since introduction, suffered serious performance failures
                        in live. This is evidenced by the following BT incident, problem, RFC and release/transition refs (insert full change history
                        of attempts to fix EDQRS, including most recent major incident ref.)<br><br>Investigations which led to this CCN<br><br>Following suggestions by the Ardentia supplier for resolving these problems, BT SUS Operations has conducted Proof Of Concept
                        (POC) experiments to establish whether MAS (the Microsoft product) will give EDQRS reports with acceptable performance. The
                        RFCs needed to conduct the initial POC work were as follows: (insert RFCs)<br><br>Initial POC has demonstrated to users that MAS does work. The result of these experiments is attached (insert Result for MAS

                        to architecture or infrastructure.  Existing MAS cube infrastructure is sufficient to host the EDQRS cube.

                        in CSA. It is assumed that the term ?printout? refers to a printer-friendly rendition of the screens defined within the scope

The printout should include (as a minimum): <br>Patient identification as a banner on the top of first page of printout and subsequent pages<br>Confidentiality statement at foot of last page of printout e.g. Personal Data about a patient: this printout should be contained
                        within the patients? notes ? wording to be confirmed in conjunction with BT (Jason Hall)<br>The date and time of the printout <br>suitable disclaimers that specify the ?security? and ?privacy? constraints applicable to viewing information derived directly
                        from a patient record, informing the reader that:<br>The information included is ?uncontrolled? and only accurate up to the time of ?printout?.<br>The reader must take appropriate steps to ensure that information contained within the ?printout is kept confidential is only
                        communicated to persons with a legitimate relationship with the patient. <br>The reader must allow individuals with a legitimate relationship with the patient to read the printout.<br>1.2.	The clinical and demographic content of the ?printout? will be limited to those data items that are displayed via CSA
                        and consequently the printout will not encompass the entire contents of the patient?s demographic and clinical record. <br>1.3.	The entire contents of any selected CSA view, will be detailed in the resulting ?printout?. This includes any information
                        that is ?off the screen?, because of any limitations in screen size. For example if 100 clinical statements were summarised
                        in a specific list view, but only 10 of the summaries could ?fit? on the screen, the hundred summaries would be detailed on
                        any print out of that view.<br>1.4.	In order to ?print out? a specific piece of information within CSA, the user will need to navigate to the ?view? in the
                        application that displays the requested information.<br>1.5.	It will only be possible for a CSA user to ?print out? details from a patient record, if he / she is viewing a patient
                        record via the application. This requirement implies that the user must have a Legitimate Relationship with the patient, as
                        it will only be possible to view a patient record if such a relationship exists.<br>1.6.	The ?Patient Record printout?, will be formatted in a manner so that its? content is clear, easy to navigate and unambiguous,

                        with the agreement made between Martyn Smith and Rob Story to progress the same.<br><br>As part of the business process of the ETP component sending batched claims to the PPD electronically, the PPD will check
                        to see that all expected batch messages have been received from the Spine and will request the re-sending of any missing batch
                        message.  The current re-send process does not involve the re-sending of the original missing batch message.  Instead the
                        reimbursement claim messages contained within the missing batch message will be scattered across subsequent batch messages
                        (ie those from missing batch message 7, can be contained in batch messages 9, 10 and 15).<br>The change solution agreed by BT and PPD is to change the approach, so that the original, missing batch message is reconstituted
                        in its entirety and resent to the PPD (eg batch message 7 is missing and batch message 7 is resent).<br><br>Reason for change:<br><br>The issue is that the PPD cannot be assured that all reimbursement claim messages have been subsequently re-sent, as the PPD
                        has no knowledge of the content of the missing batch message and therefore can not perform any reconciliation procedures to
                        check that all reimbursement claim messages have been received. As such, the current process does not provide a viable audit
                        trail and does not provide NHS stakeholders with any guarantee that all reimbursement claim messages in the missing Batch
                        Message have been subsequently received as part of the resend process.  <br><br>The proposed change should provide the guarantee that all reimbursement claim messages intended for the PPD are received.

                        coding schemes ? READ, SNOMED CT and dm+d.<br><br>Description of change:<br><br>The Terminology Reference Data Update Distribution service (TRUD) was established to manage the synchronised delivery of updates
                        to terminology reference data (SNOMED Clinical Terms, READ Codes and the Dictionary of Medicines and Devices) to a select
                        number of accredited Distribution End Points associated with the UK National Care Records Service, Local Service Providers
                        (LSPs), third party suppliers and Community Pharmacy system suppliers.  These End Points would then be responsible for loading
                        the data into end point chosen databases and onward delivery to end systems under their control.<br><br>The current mechanism for distributing the reference data to the LSPs and third party suppliers is manual via DVD.  In future
                        NHS Connecting for Health intends to distribute the terminology reference data electronically via File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
                        utilising WSDL in conjunction with <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#SOAP" title="Simple Object Access Protocol: SOAP is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of Web Services in computer networks.">SOAP</a> over http.  File Transfer Protocol is a standard Internet protocol, and the simplest way to exchange files between computers
                        on the Internet. WSDL is a standard mechanism, which is utilised as part of <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#HL7" title="Health Level Seven: HL7 and its members provide a framework (and related standards) for the exchange, integration, sharing and retrieval of electronic health information.">HL7</a> framework.

                        release data.  Introducing an electronic distribution mechanism requires developing an understanding among LSPs of the requisite
                        changes and impact.  All receiver systems will need to have the delivery architecture in place and have appropriate bandwidth
                        availability. It is preferred that receiver systems be connected to N3 and have approved access to the SPINE, but World Wide
                        Web functionality will be provided as an additional option.  <br><br>Therefore LSPs are asked to carry out an impact analysis of the Terminology Service automating what is currently a standard,

                        be shared between multiple servers. To achieve this for a sensible cost SE have suggested a NAS storage solution from Network
                        Appliance (v3020c) using the protocol NFSv3. The NAS offering from Sun was rejected as not suitable as it was unable to offer
                        the required capabilities (for example synchronous replication). To address the path to Live as currently understood it will
                        be necessary to provide several â€˜dropsâ€™ of this infrastructure, initially in INT2 but also for OTR2 (provided for in this
                        CCN), NIS4 and Live (requires additional CCN/expenditure).<br>Glasgow Solution<br>The obvious alternative provider of this technology is Network Appliance (commonly known as NetApp). This is a BT supplier,
                        however, it is understood the preferred procurement route for the NetApp v3020c is via Sun. Given the difficult time constraints
                        I would like assurance that this preferred procurement path will deliver to the deadline of March 23rd 2007 for the storage
                        to be deployed and available in Glasgow datacentre for INT2. The first application to need this storage is ALI/ERS.<br>This change is dependent on the delivery of two existing CCNs prior to March 23rd 2007, CCN 1291 and CCN 1296. In reality
                        the components needed to deliver CCN1291 are nearly in place â€“ the primary concern is around CCN1296 where orders are still
                        to be placed on equipment with a 4 week lead-time.<br>It is proposed to use a capability of the NetApp storage range called Multistore to logically partition/segregate the storage
                        so that each of the Glasgow environments can share the same physical infrastructure, but will appear to have separate NAS
                        storage (thus avoiding additional expense for the programme). Therefore INT2 will use one virtual NAS â€˜filerâ€™ and OTR2 can
                        use a logically separate virtual NAS â€˜filerâ€™. Although the urgency is derived from the date required for INT2, this solution
                        will also be able to meet the OTR2 requirement in June. It is also not tied to ALI. Although this application appears to have
                        the most urgent need for this capability, there are other applications which are apparently requiring the ability to share
                        the same storage volume amongst more than one non-clustered server â€“ therefore driving the need for this solution.<br>Although this solution will be capable of replication it is not expected to need this facility in Glasgow environments. Snapshotting
                        capabilities are also available to ensure live like mechanisms exist for testing or backup.

                        This change has far-reaching consequences and has been submitted as a change request to raise the visibility of the issue
                        and help expedite impact assessment and planning by all Directorates involved.<br>Benefits<br>The move to Oracle 10gR2 will allow Spine to take advantage of OracleÂ¿s High Availability architecture; including Real Application
                        Clusters, Data Guard, Recovery Manager, and Enterprise Manager.  10g also provides improved storage management facilities
                        through Automatic Storage Management (ASM).  New, or improved, features that are expected to benefit Spine more or less immediately
                        include:<br>Â¿	Dramatic reduction is site failover time Â¿ down to 70 sec from over 4 hours for a typical Spine Oracle database.<br>Â¿	Improved partitioning Â¿ will allow adoption of Information Lifecycle Management (ILM)<br>Â¿	ASM Â¿ is expected to allow us to free-up a large amount of storage that has been allocated to various databases and not
                        used.  Estimates vary between 35 TB and 60 TB, although the higher figure (from Sun Microsystems) includes storage recovered
                        from more than simply migrating to ASM.<br>Â¿	Improved performance for certain data types such as CLOB (character large object) used by Spine.<br>Â¿	Utilities that provide for easier migration and enhanced XQuery support.<br>Â¿	Improved security permits focus on policy rather than low-level implementation.  Also 10gR2 fixes some outstanding security
                        issues that we have not been able to apply to 9.2.0.6.<br>Â¿	Improved data base management functionality such as enhanced back-up, recovery and restore.  Flashback technology restores
                        tables to a particular point in time extremely quickly.<br>Â¿	Improved auditing automates tracking of user activities at a very detailed level.<br>Scope<br>The proposed change covers the Oracle 10g Release 2 RDBMS with and associated software components including:<br>Â¿	RDBMS Â¿ 10.2.0.2, 64 bit<br>Â¿	CRS Â¿ 10.2.0.2<br>Â¿	ASM Â¿ 10.2.0.2<br>Â¿	Grid Control Â¿ 10.2.0.2<br>Â¿	Client Libs Â¿ 9.2.0.6 ; 32 bit (10gR2 32 bit libraries not available for Solaris / SPARC)<br>Â¿	Oracle Warehouse Builder (OWB)- 10.2.0.1<br>Not all of these elements will necessarily be required for every subsystem at the same time Â¿ the most notable exceptions
                        being SDS and CA that are intended to remain with Oracle 9i until such time as their COTS products are certified for 10g or
                        replaced.<br>This Oracle upgrade is part of the mandated Target Software Stack (TSS) Â¿ a component of the standard operating environment
                        (SOE) Â¿ that has been authorised for this release by the Release Board.  The SOE has been included in the Standards Information
                        Base (SIB) that will be issued with the 2007a SAD.  Changes will be managed using low-level change control under the aegis
                        of the 2007a Release Board.<br>The subsystems impacted by this change are:<br>Â¿	CSA<br>Â¿	ERS<br>Â¿	ETP<br>Â¿	PDS<br>Â¿	DSA (no database in 2006b2)<br>Â¿	TES<br>Â¿	<a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#TMS" title="Transaction Message Service: Existing Spine system that secures, routes, validates and transforms messages between endpoints and endpoints and endpoints and NASPs.">TMS</a><br>Â¿	SDS (IDM) Â¿ End Point Registration (EPR) data base only<br>The following subsystems are already uplifted to Oracle 10gR2 in 2006b2:<br>Â¿	ACF<br>Â¿	PSIS<br>Subsystems that will remain on Oracle 9i until resolution of the COTS product certification issues are:<br>Â¿	CA (IDM) Â¿ Entrust applications not certified for 10g until early 2007.<br>Â¿	SDS (IDM) Â¿ Calendra and Entrust not certified.<br>Though the Oracle 9i version must still be uplifted to the final 9i release level in order to retain even passive support
                        from Oracle.  Due to constraints in running two versions of Oracle in the same cluster, it may be necessary to deploy IDM

                        have been introduced by the Department of Health.<br><br>All controlled drugs are listed in one of five Schedules to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001, according to their therapeutic
                        usefulness, their potential for abuse and the perceived need for control.   Schedule 1 controlled drugs have little or no
                        therapeutic value, are addictive and have a high potential for abuse; they are the most strictly controlled. The remaining
                        schedules up to 5 list controlled drugs which require decreasing amounts of control. Schedule 5 includes preparations containing
                        controlled drugs such as codeine or morphine, used in such low strength that they present little or no risk of abuse and can
                        be sold over the counter.  Only controlled drugs listed in schedules 4 and 5 are in scope for ISPs for the Electronic Prescription
                        Service. Current legislation does not permit the fully electronic prescriptions for controlled drugs listed in the other schedules.<br><br>This Change Control Note confirms the technical requirements for the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) with respect to
                        the prescribing and dispensing of controlled drugs and particularly the list of controlled drugs included in Schedule 4 of
                        the Misuse of Drugs Act. The requirements for schedule 5 controlled drugs have not changed. <br><br>The following has been confirmed by the Department of Health following a request by CfH to confirm the changes within the
                        Misuse of Drugs Act:<br><br>1.	Under the new arrangements, the prescription expiry period for prescribed controlled drugs has changed from 91 days to
                        28 days, but only for schedules 2, 3 and 4.<br><br>2.	The prescription expiry period for schedule 5 controlled drugs is unchanged and is 6 months.<br><br>3.	Legislation regarding the use of advanced digital signatures for signing prescriptions has not changed. Prescriptions for
                        schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs cannot be digitally signed (and must be hand-signed in ink) while Schedule 4 and 5 prescriptions
                        can be digitally signed or hand-signed.<br><br>4.	Schedule 4 and 5 controlled drugs may be prescribed using any of the EPS prescribing models (i.e. Acute Prescribing, Repeat
                        Prescribing and Repeat Dispensing).<br><br>5.	When a Schedule 4 controlled drug is prescribed using Repeat Dispensing, the first issue will be subject to a 28 day expiry
                        period. All subsequent issues will be valid for up to 12 months from the date of the prescription authorisation.<br><br>6.	When a Schedule 5 controlled drug is prescribed using Repeat Dispensing, only the first issue is subject to the 6 month
                        expiry rule. Subsequent issues are subject to the established Repeat Dispensing rules of within 12 months from the original
                        authorisation.<br><br>7.	Regulation changes that apply to NHS prescriptions and will become statutory when changes to the Misuse of Drugs Act come
                        into force in June 2006 <br><br>8.	Private prescriptions remain out of scope for the EPS. <br><br>9.	One of the new safer management guidelines for dispensers is to send photocopies of private controlled drug prescriptions
                        to the PPA. It is assumed that this applies only to private prescriptions and this requirement does not apply to NHS prescriptions
                        for controlled drugs. <br><br>10.	The paper FP10 form has changed to accommodate a new prescription collector signature requirement for schedule 2 and 3
                        controlled drugs. It is assumed this requirement does not apply for schedule 4 and 5 controlled drugs.<br><br>NB: the reference to schedules contained within the 10 assumptions above, outlines the controlled drugs listed in Schedules
                        1 - 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 and has no reference to contractual scheduling.<br><br>Thus the scope of the EPS for CDs is outlined in the following table.<br><br>Controlled Drug Schedule	Legal Requirement	EPS Scope	ExpiryDate	Repeat Dispensing<br>				R/D allowed	1st Issue expiry	Subsequent Issues expiry<br>1<br>	N/A	Out of s

                        of this attribute removed from the 2006-B2 release.  The following is an explanation.<br><br>The issue revolves around the 'eb:PartyId' tag. The associated 'eb:type' attribute is optional, but if present the attribute
                        value must be present and in the correct format.  The attribute value is case sensitive and with the introduction of 2006-B2
                        becomes a validated field. In particular:<br><br>"urn:nhs:names:partyType:ocs+serviceInstance"<br><br>And<br><br>"urn:nhs:names:partytype:ocs+serviceInstance"<br><br>are distinct attribute values.  Technically, the first is correct and the second is incorrect having 'partytype' with a lower-case
                        't'.  The ITB believe this position is clear and well known.<br><br>CFH ITB request the validation of the eb:PartId eb:type attribute and attribute value be removed from the 2006-B2 release.<br><br>The attribute 'eb:type' is optional and therefore the ITB feel that its validation is not required.<br><br>This issue has previously been discussed by the ITB and STIF and therefore is well understood in the program.

Currently, the application only allows individual files to be selected (although it does allow a user to iteratively select
                        single entries). We would like to see the ability to include multiple file selections (using shift or control, etc). This
                        would give us the option to use lots of small files (say with a single payload) rather<br>than a small number of large files.<br><br>2. Most PDS <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#HL7" title="Health Level Seven: HL7 and its members provide a framework (and related standards) for the exchange, integration, sharing and retrieval of electronic health information.">HL7</a> records require a valid version number before they can be processed. Using the current tool this is very tedious and requires
                        this version number to be obtained manually from the database and then this value inserted into the data before it can be
                        subsequently processed. We would like an automated process that requires the utility to:<br>a. Retrieve, at run-time, from PDS the appropriate version number(s) and unique_id(s) - I gather the query uses the person.allData
                        parameter in the RetrievalItem tag of the PdsRetrievalQuery <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#HL7" title="Health Level Seven: HL7 and its members provide a framework (and related standards) for the exchange, integration, sharing and retrieval of electronic health information.">HL7</a> message. This data is returned in an XML message from PDS from which it is easy to extract the version number and id's required.<br>b. Substitute within the XML update message the version numbers and unique_ids (as obtained above). We would expect placeholders
                        to be located within the XML to make substitution easy (for example, the string "{Version_Number}" would be included which
                        would then be substituted with the appropriate value). The modified message would then be passed to PDS for processing (as
                        per the current process).<br><br>3. Extend the functionality to include an interface to ETP as well as PDS, PSIS and ACF.<br><br>4.  Ability to capture all responses into a log file.

In 2007-A it will also be responsible for logging <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#TMS" title="Transaction Message Service: Existing Spine system that secures, routes, validates and transforms messages between endpoints and endpoints and endpoints and NASPs.">TMS</a> performance and diagnostic logs and making the performance data available to ERS in the required format and via the mechanism
                        specified by ERS. At present, this component has to be developed and delivered. This CCN is to make the Syslog server part
                        of the ERS sub-system from 2007-A onwards.<br>1.	Development of Syslog component for logging perf records from <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#TMS" title="Transaction Message Service: Existing Spine system that secures, routes, validates and transforms messages between endpoints and endpoints and endpoints and NASPs.">TMS</a> (CLS) to NAS. <br>The current preferred design is to replace the current (2006-B2) http logging and make use of the already existing CLS SYSLOG
                        route.  There is a freeware product SYSLOGNG (a more elaborate version of standard Unix syslog) that write all logs to the
                        log file on CLS server. A component has to be developed that will filter the single log file on CLS and will create a file
                        for performance log only on NAS for ERS via the flat file route using NFS.<br>As the Syslog server interface component is not yet developed, it is expected that the server build with the component will
                        need to go through FQT again.<br>2.	Transfer of Syslog components ownership to Mastek<br>This CCN transfers above (CLS to NAS) component development and following service accountability for the CLS server from 2007-A
                        through the full test lifecycle and onwards into production (in line with any existing production support arrangements). The
                        current responsibilities and functionality of the CLS servers includes:<br> 1. All Sarvega appliances send their alarms, security and sg logs to the CLS servers (i.e. not just performance data)<br>2. Logmon is monitoring these log files (specifically the alarms and sg logs) for service affecting events and alerting to
                        Omnibus via BTtrap.<br>3. syslog-ng is currently configured to prepend every syslog message with the following fields: datetime, sourceIP and severity.
                        The sourceIP field is used to 'spoof' the source address of the BTtrap when it is sent to Omnibus so the event appears to
                        come from the Sarvega device as opposed to the CLS server.  If required this feature can be turn off for performance records.<br>4.

Syslog-NG is also configured to maintain the functionality of the standard Solaris syslog daemon which it replaces (i.e.
                        logging local system events to /var/adm/messages and /var/log/syslog).<br>8. The syslog server uses reverse DNS lookups to lookup the hostname of the source IP addresses and creates the log file directory
                        structure accordingly i.e. all logs from PNAU001-UKBR will appear under the /syslog/pnau001-ukbr/ directory on the local filesystem.<br>Note that on acceptance of this change, SE 2007-A documents will be uplifted to reflect the inclusion of the Syslog server
                        solution into the ERS sub-system architecture. Any requirements to change the services provided by the Syslog server for 2007-A
                        onwards will need to be channelled through SE. <br><br>See the "Design Principles" section of the "Transfer of ownership of Syslog server to Mastek v1 0" document in the attachments

                        This interface will allow a user to securely upload a data file to the Spine. The Spine will subsequently trace the records
                        in the file against the PDS and then return the file to the user. The Authority does not require an email interface or handling
                        of physical media.<br><br>The design for the batch service is described in:<br><br>â€¢	NPFIT-FNT-TO-DSD-00171 08 v1 0 PDS Batch Trace 2007-ABUC.doc<br>â€¢	CCN851 Legacy Batch Trace v6.ppt<br><br>The batch service shall be made available as soon as possible, but no later than release 2008-A. <br>This CCN is the implementation of CCN0162 (BT CCN 851), first raised in December 2005.<br><br>The first phase of the CCN is for the Contractor to provide detailed costs in its impact analysis. The Authority will make
                        a decision to proceed based upon these costs. <br><br>Project Delivery<br><br>It is proposed that the CCN is impacted and developed using a single team of Authority and Contractor staff. The team should
                        consider the various aspects of the CCN in order to minimise the delay in developing a response.<br><br>If possible, this project should be implemented without any changes to the existing Spine. If this is possible, then consideration
                        may be given to considering it a local system in scope, with testing more appropriate to a Local Systems Provider. This should
                        remove the need for Regression Testing and greatly simplify Integration Testing.<br><br>If it is not possible to implement the project without changes to the existing Spine, consideration should be taken to incorporating
                        any required changes in the 2007-A release and then implementing the other elements in the 2008-A release.<br><br>Volumetrics<br><br>The infrastructure costs for the batch service should not include any increase for existing Spine systems as this falls within
                        the existing scope of the Spine Service. This is because the organisations that will use the NSTS batch trace replacement
                        have already been included as connecting to the Spine via <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#HL7" title="Health Level Seven: HL7 and its members provide a framework (and related standards) for the exchange, integration, sharing and retrieval of electronic health information.">HL7</a> v3 messaging. <br><br>For the avoidance of doubt, additional costs should only be for the infrastructure necessary to convert between NSTS file
                        and <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#HL7" title="Health Level Seven: HL7 and its members provide a framework (and related standards) for the exchange, integration, sharing and retrieval of electronic health information.">HL7</a> v3 messaging. Similar consideration should be given to service and other costs.<br><br>The Authority has updated the assumptions regarding its volumetric calculations based upon the LSP rollout. The changes are:<br><br>â€¢	ESP PAS systems will now need to use this service. <br>â€¢	NHS Wales user volumes should be included.<br><br>An updated volumetric assumptions spreadsheet is attached to the CCN. This will be the final set of figures from the Authority.<br><br>The scope of the service should include NHS England, Wales and DHSS Isle of Man. DHSS Isle of Man volumes are negligible.<br><br>Assumptions<br><br>â€¢	The Authority will provide suitable network connectivity for user organisations.<br>â€¢	The service should allow files to be submitted at any time, but they will only be processed in non-working hours.

                        content.<br>-----------------<br>Background<br><br>There is a facility built into the specification of systems for override of "Dissent to Share", expressed as DissentOverride
                        in the CfH MIM (Assigned OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.3.2.4.17.60).<br><br>Current reasons for override of dissent are defined as:<br><br>Code	Description	Note<br>0	No override	<br>1	Access made in the public interest	<br>2	Access required by statute	<br>3	Access required by Court Order	<br>4	Query for update, System-to-System use only (no display)	May not be presented as a choice to user. <br>Subject of CCN427<br><br>Change description<br><br>We need a further - fifth - code to dissent override - "Temporary Access with Patient Consent". This will be implemented through
                        the reuse of code '5' (deprecated from MIM4.2), resulting in a further row in the above table:<br><br>5	Temporary access with patient consent	Subject of this CCN<br><br>This code / text change will be reflected in MIM6.3 (final) and represented in systems using this form of dissent override,
                        including CSA, from 2008-A.<br><br>No new system behaviour is expected other than adherence to this revised vocabulary. <br><br>Reason for change: <br>A scenario exists where the patient has dissented to share their summary care record; clinically relevant information exists,
                        and the patient may wish the clinician to see this information in the context of a particular clinical setting, but still
                        wish to maintain the overall dissent to sharing. <br><br>Consequence of no change: <br>Where a Clinician needed to over-ride "dissent to share" with the patient's consent, it would be necessary for the clinician
                        to manually change this consent flag on PDS, and then change it back again once the record had been viewed. This opens the
                        record, in a less audited and secure way, to access from across the NHS for the temporary period of "consent to share".

                        of RAs to manage other usersâ€™ smartcards and for users to be able to manage their own smartcards e.g. change its passcode.

                        the 2008-B release, as agreed by the 2008-B Release Definition Board on 13/06/07.<br>Background to the Change<br>Spine load balancers generally implement a KeepAlive mechanism to determine whether to route traffic to a given instance of
                        the application.<br>In many cases, the implementation of the KeepAlive is unsophisticated (TCP port check or â€œnaÃ¯veâ€� query e.g. <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#HTTP" title="Hypertext Transport Protocol: Protocol used to convery information on the world wide web - typically used in conjunction with HTML to present web pages to clients.">HTTP</a> home page query).<br>This creates failure modes whereby the KeepAlive returns a â€œfalse positiveâ€� even though it is unable to process traffic. This
                        applies to <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#HTTP" title="Hypertext Transport Protocol: Protocol used to convery information on the world wide web - typically used in conjunction with HTML to present web pages to clients.">HTTP</a> and RMI interfaces.<br>Details of Change<br>The change is to implement a bespoke keepalive responder for <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#HTTP" title="Hypertext Transport Protocol: Protocol used to convery information on the world wide web - typically used in conjunction with HTML to present web pages to clients.">HTTP</a> and RMI interfaces, where one does not already exist.<br>E.g. for an <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#HTTP" title="Hypertext Transport Protocol: Protocol used to convery information on the world wide web - typically used in conjunction with HTML to present web pages to clients.">HTTP</a> interface in a J2EE app server, the responder would be a servlet.<br>Features:<br>â€¢	Perform a reasonable check of ability to process requests over the interface<br>â€¢	E.g. check ability to access dependent resources such as DB or <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#LDAP" title="Lightweight Directory Access Protocol: Is an application protocol for querying and modifying directory services running over TCP/IP.">LDAP</a> i/f<br>â€¢	Respond with AVAILABLE or DEAD accordingly (no response implies DEAD!)<br>â€¢	Ability to switch to â€œalways DEADâ€� or â€œalways AVAILABLEâ€� modes via CLI. The former supports graceful shutdown because it
                        tells the load balancer to stop sending traffic whilst allowing existing traffic to run its course (although note this would
                        not be useful for sticky sessions). The latter might be useful to override faulty behaviour.<br>â€¢	Ability to query whether in â€œalways DEADâ€� or â€œalways AVAILABLEâ€� mode.<br>â€¢	Appropriate security context so that it can be accessed by the load balancer (which does not have a smartcard) but cannot
                        be accessed by any party beyond the load balancer<br>â€¢	Also exposed as a JMX interface to allow Service to perform the same query (related to Get Availability OSS use case)<br>The change is restricted to those sub-systems that are â€œopen for businessâ€� (i.e. experiencing other change) in 2008-B.<br>The full list of impacted sub-systems is to be determined during elaboration. It will definitely include DSA, which is known
                        to have a gap in this area.

                        business needs. <br>Accordingly this CCN has been drafted to set aside that ambiguity and (i) to require the development of tests and test plans,
                        (ii) on instruction by the Authority the execution of test plans, (iii) following agreement the provision of on-going support

                        2003.<br>The testing and more particularly the Support should also extend and encompass any developments or derivatives of the above
                        from the date on their full release and should be offered to 2013 as a minimum. In addition backward compatibility to 2.0

                        ramp-up periods.<br><br><br>Part B.<br>The Authority requires BT to prove the Clinical Spine Application supports the use of the Citrix Universal Print Driver for
                        PCL based printers.  As a minimum it is expected that BT will prove this with two or more printers including the HP LaserJet

                        Sealing data will henceforth be maintained separately from clinical data/documents.<br><br>A mechanism for local systems (LSP, ESP, CSA, etc) to update sealed envelope information independently of the clinical information
                        being sealed, must be provided by Spine (â€˜Retrospective sealingâ€™). Mechanisms for <br><br>- querying for sealed envelope information independently of requesting that clinical information (â€œSealing contextâ€�), and<br><br>- querying seals on the basis of NHS Number (â€œSealing historyâ€�) <br><br>must also be provided.<br><br>No additional UI is required to support these services in the back office. This CCN is aimed at providing a messaging interface
                        only. <br><br>It is expected that, although sealed envelope data will be separate to clinical data, sealing data and clinical data will
                        be able to be transmitted, from accredited system to Spine, and also accredited system to accredited system â€˜throughâ€™ spine/<a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#TMS" title="Transaction Message Service: Existing Spine system that secures, routes, validates and transforms messages between endpoints and endpoints and endpoints and NASPs.">TMS</a>, within the same message (note: separate to CDA document).  For â€˜contemporaneous sealingâ€™, it is expected that the number
                        of interactions between accredited systems and Spine will not increase.<br><br>Access to sealing services (update and retrieve) is expected to be through a lightweight, synchronous webservice, except when
                        consolidated with PSIS document/service requests..<br><br>MIM interactions will be updated accordingly by CfH: Clinical documents will have sealing structures removed (including the
                        removal of sealed envelope-related templates) but not including the â€˜Refusal to Sealâ€™ document. NPfIT CDA documents will henceforth
                        contain a â€˜restrictedâ€™ flag to conform to <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#HL7" title="Health Level Seven: HL7 and its members provide a framework (and related standards) for the exchange, integration, sharing and retrieval of electronic health information.">HL7</a> CDA. PSIS Query request/responses will be updated to conform to any new metadata structures required. It is expected that
                        BT Spine and CfH collaborate closely on this work in order to minimise elapsed time for this change.<br><br>In the 2008-A Spine release, we are not expecting to be able to prescribe specific lists of users or workgroups which can
                        access an item of sealed information without breaking that seal. In other words, Sealed Envelope accessor lists have been
                        simplified to a single â€˜sealedâ€™/â€˜not sealedâ€™ status for sealed/unsealed items. It is essential that in providing a separate
                        mechanism for sealing, we allow for future flexibility / extension in this area: for example, a means of representing more
                        specific access control, in the future. In the simplified sealed/not sealed model, â€˜sealedâ€™ status is equivalent to an â€˜emptyâ€™
                        accessor list, and equivalent to â€˜deny [view] to allâ€™, in conventional ACL terms.<br><br>In the 2008-A Spine release, sealed envelopes will be reduced in their granularity to whole NPfIT CDA documents only, i.e.
                        there will no longer be a requirement, in this release, to seal at the more granular, â€œInformation Componentâ€� or â€œDocument
                        Sectionâ€� level. In future releases, VPD data will require access to sealing functionality; this must be considered as a possible
                        future extension.<br><br>For the avoidance of doubt, PSIS will continue to serve documents to client systems, which have been marked as â€˜sealedâ€™. It
                        will continue to be the responsibility of the requesting system to mediate access to sealed information, according to simple
                        prescribed rules. Alerts for sealing will also continue to be the responsibility of a local system.  <br><br>This CCN affects national clinical documents only and does not relate to local sealing implementations.

                        spine release. Making this change will realise substantial clinical and financial benefits and mitigate a number of significant
                        clinical and reputational risks. NB. The opportunity to make this change has only been available since the approach to sealing
                        changed from statement level to document level sealing (CCN387) and the change outlined here represents the approach that
                        would have been adopted from the outset, but for the requirement to have â€œin-documentâ€� statement-level sealing. <br><br>Description of changes<br><br>The proposed change has three aspects (supporting information is provided in the form of a Slide Deck (CDAProposal.ppt (including
                        indicative RMiMs )):<br><br>a.	Simplification of Text Sections<br>Currently, the 2008-A CDA documents are broken into atomic information components, each of which may be coded or non-coded,
                        but all of which must have a title section. This is to enable patients to seal part(s) of a document. The consequence of this
                        approach is that the document becomes fragmented and the different fragments cannot be rendered in a way that preserves a
                        natural document format.<br><br>The proposal is to replace this atomic structure with a unified structure that makes it a simple matter to construct clinical
                        documents in a clinically natural and familiar form. The unity of the structure will be provided by the use of one or more
                        text sections that may or may not have multiple coded templates and CRE types associated with them. The key point is that
                        the use of coded templates and indexing against CRE types would function at least as effectively as on the current approach,
                        but would not impose an artificial and unnecessarily fragmented structure upon clinical documents.<br><br>The contractual documentation impacted by this change is MiM 6.2 Draft B and the change would affect the RMiMs, Example Messages,
                        Schemas, Schematrons, Tabular Views for all CDA domains (including PSIS Queries and HealthSpace). It is anticipated that the
                        full set of MiM changes would take 2-3 weeks.<br><br>By making this change we will greatly increase the flexibility of the CDA Documents and make it 	possible to construct clinical
                        documents that have a natural narrative format. The documents will better support clinical practice and will make it significantly
                        easier for end systems to render CDA documents. <br><br><br>b.	Removal of Business Sections<br>Currently, the CDA documents contain 4 business sections. These perform no semantic function within the message and are used
                        merely at the presentation level to provide some high-level groupings to the fragmented documents. Removing them is a trivial
                        change that has been agreed by clinical advisers. The benefit of making this change is that it allows greater flexibility
                        in the use of the CDA documents since no presentation level grouping would be imposed on the documents. In this way it would
                        be a simple matter for the CDA documents to support directives and guidance provided by the Royal Colleges and other professional
                        bodies (e.g. the RCP work on Standardised Clinical Documentation).<br><br><br>c.	Inclusion of Encompassing Encounter within CDA Clinical Documents<br>Currently, the CDA documents do not make use of Encompassing Encounter (a standard component of CDA), instead they use the
                        Care Event template to describe the type of care provided and the setting within which care was delivered. This is less than
                        ideal, since it does not allow clinicians to distinguish between the overall encounter type and specific care events that
                        take place within that encounter. It is proposed that we use Encompassing Encounter within the clinical CDA documents and
                        this is the approach that would have been taken had the clinical use of the component been properly understood at the outset.
                        This is a trivial change that is well supported by clinical advisors and the supplier community.

                        number of missed requirements which will be dealt with separately.  These configuration changes will allow the extracts to
                        get much closer to the desired output than would be the case without them and will allow for detailed analysis to be done
                        in order for any further changes to be requested after 2008-A has gone live. <br><br>A spreadsheet detailing the changes required is attached to this document.

                        the 2008-A release.  This required NHS CFH to provide an interim process for uploading these migrations on to the SDS prior
                        to the 2008-A release.<br><br>Software has been developed internally within NHS CFH which has been used successfully in a number of migrations to assist
                        with the migration of people data.  This allows migrating/splitting NHS organisations, which have allocated smartcards to
                        their employees, to be migrated seamlessly over to their new Organisation.  Although the tool allows the collation and validation
                        of this data, there is a need for the <a class="glossary-link" href="../glossary.html#NASP" title="National Application Service Provider: Name given to NPfIT national services such as those offered by Spine as well as Choose and Book.">NASP</a> to upload this data against the new Organisation.<br><br>This CCN will cover a call off number 50 ad hoc migrations to support any migrating organisations up to the release of 2008-A.

                        and provide a firm proposal with associated resource requirements and costs for the implementation of these migrations using
                        the tools developed under BT0850.<br><br>These migrations will use the current interim processes and software which have been used successfully as defined in BT0850.<br><br>To enable BT to estimate the resources required, BT should assume:<br><br>1.	That each migration data file will contain a variable number of users to migrate, with a current maximum of 8000 users
                        per file. <br>2.	That the Authority will, each week, send to the designated BT Contact for processing, one or more files to migrate.  The
                        files that are to be migrated in a week will be based on a migration plan and schedule to be agreed with BT (the initial draft
                        of which is attached to this CCN).  Where this schedule does not cover all planned migrations or needs to be varied, then
                        the Authority will provide BT with at least one monthâ€™s advance notice of migrations to take place in a subsequent month.<br>3.	That the process will not exceed the release of 2008-A.<br>4.	To request weekend cover (where required) to support the NHS in identifying and correcting any run time errors regarding
                        the migration and to support the possibility of a migration â€˜roll backâ€™. <br>5.	Each migration request will result in 3 standard changes being created (Merger, Extract and Closure).  The NHS CFH and
                        BT change teams have agreed standard change templates for these RFCs.

                        information.<br>----------------------<br>Description of change:<br>This CCN requires a change to include the following points:<br><br>1.	The bulk removal of service users from a supplied list will be accessed by a wider group of users than the other bulk moves
                        functionality.  It therefore requires a unique RBAC control.  I.e. it needs to appear as a menu option in it's own right so
                        that it can be accessed separately from the other bulk move functionality.<br>2.	There is a requirement to be able to submit a single file containing service users from a number of different GP Practices
                        and for the system to process the removal of these service users from their respective GP Practice.  (The current design only
                        allows removal from a single GP list at a time).  Appropriate validation of the supplied list and access to any resulting
                        error files is also required.<br>Reason for change:<br> At the demonstration of the DSA PCRBO system to the PCRBO user group on the 15th August 2007, the users highlighted two key
                        deficiencies in the proposed design for bulk removals that they asked to be remedied in the final design. These are contained
                        within this CCN.<br><br>As communicated via ACES (NPFIT-15984) on 26th September 2007 this is one of the 2008-B Demographics Outstanding Elaboration
                        Issues that have been identified as business requirements during the Elaboration but are not yet included in the requirements
                        baseline due to the time pressures associated with operating the elaboration under strict time controls. As agreed at the
                        Joint Functional Board on the 20th September this is being progressed via a change control process to be brought in to the
                        requirements baseline. <br><br>This requirement is contained within the 2008-B Demographics vision and it is expected that this CCN will not result in a
                        charge to NHS CFH for this change control.<br>Consequence of no change: <br>Inability to proceed with 2008-B design

                        team electronically. Without this CCN all organisation changes will need to be re-keyed.<br><br>Following discussions with CfH this proposed change has been identified which will enable the existing back office team to
                        support the volume of change within their existing head count. <br><br>As this change could not be accommodated within the 2008-A release the back office team will be increased when the release
                        goes live to handle the additional workload. The change would allow the back office team to be reduced to it's current head
                        count and is therefore required as soon as possible.<br><br>Note that the existing mechanism, which uses meta connectors to upload new and amended data directly into the directory, will
                        not be useable following the 2008-A release given the re-development of this whole area of functionality as per Bundle 265.<br><br>Requirements<br><br>Currently the bulk creation connector that is being provided as part of Bundle 265 for the 2008-A release only allows NEW

                        organisation/site/department then all the contacts pertaining to that organisation/site/department need to be provided which
                        will replace the existing contacts of the organisation/site/department.

                        information.<br>-------------------<br>Background<br><br>The current baselined requirements defining the SDS Organisation Administration Service (OAS) functionality state that the
                        System must allow the User to submit a request to re-parent one or more organisations by specifying the current parent organisation
                        and the new parent organisation. The selection of the new parent organisations is restricted to organisations of the same
                        type as the current parent. The reason for this restriction was to avoid complications that could arise as a result of the
                        inherited characteristics, should the new parent template type definition vary from that of the current parent template type
                        definition.<br><br>The main template type definitions that could give rise to complications are:<br><br>"	The mandatory associations inherited from the parent organisation.<br>"	The RA Category of the Parent Organisation.<br>"	The permitted parent types for the children of a particular organisation may vary making it impossible to re-parent all
                        the child organisations to the same parent organisation.<br><br>NHS CFH has stated that the baselined requirements are too restrictive and would prevent them from carrying out mandated organisation
                        reconfigurations. For instance, in the event that a Primary Care Trust (PCT) type organisation converts to a Care Trust type
                        organisation all the PCT's children would effectively need to be re-parented to the new Care Trust organisation set up to
                        replace the PCT. As it stands the application functionality would not allow this operation.<br><br>Requirement<br><br>CfH have requested that the OAS functionality is modified as follows:<br><br>1.	Allow particular organisation types to be grouped by the Authority for the purposes of the bulk re-parent request. There
                        is no requirement for these groupings to be configurable and there will be no facility covered by this CCN to add or remove
                        groupings from those specified against this CCN.<br><br>2.	OAS must allow organisations belonging to a parent organisation of a type included in one of these groups to be re-parented
                        to any organisation of a type specified in the same group.<br><br>3.	OAS must validate at submission of the bulk re-parent request that if the organisation types of the current and new parent
                        differ, the two organisation type are still compatible in terms of the rules of association and permitted child types. In
                        the case where the organisation types are not compatible, the System must display an appropriate error message and prevent
                        the re-parent request from being submitted.<br><br>In the example of the PCT/Care Trust scenario, if the current parent is of type PCT, the System would permit the User to choose
                        the new parent organisation from organisations of type PCT or Care Trust. If the current parent type was Care Trust, the System
                        would allow the User to select the new parent from PCT or Care Trust type organisations.<br><br>Clarifications<br><br>Subsequent to the creation of this CCN CfH have provided a clarification (attached below) that:<br><br>1.	There will be a single re-parenting group containing the PCT and Care Trust organisation types.<br><br>2.	Organisation type compatibility means that the rules specified in the respective templates governing associations and relations
                        to other organisation types are identical.

                        for the most up-to-date information.<br><br>1.	User Details Management<br>a.	NHS CRS to provide real-time and batch mechanisms for ESR to add, amend, view and delete User RBAC (based on Positions)
                        and other user information.<br>b.	NHS CRS to provide a real-time mechanism for ESR to determine user smartcard issuance status.<br>c.	NHS CRS should expose all RBAC-related functions to the control of ESR, including those set out in other CCNs; for example,
                        CCN1160.<br>d.	NHS CRS to provide initial data load to ESR.<br>e.	NHS CRS to distinguish between ESR records and NHS CRS-only records.  That is, NHS CRS Users who are also registered on
                        ESR and whose details may only be managed using ESR.<br>f.	NHS CFH's envisages  use of the Interface in the following scenarios:<br>1.	ESR person search request to NHS CRS<br>2.	ESR retrieve person details from NHS CRS<br>3.	ESR create person request to NHS CRS<br>4.	ESR update person entry request to NHS CRS<br>5.	ESR delete person entry request to NHS CRS<br>g.	On receipt of a message from ESR, NHS CRS should operate as if used natively.  For example, using the RA's UUID to ensure
                        RA Restrictions are enforced. <br>h.	NHS CRS should not allow ESR to create a person entry without a corresponding photograph.<br>i.	The messages-peak-load is estimated in the region of 1.23 messages per second.  Total inbound messages per annum estimated
                        to average 7 million.<br><br>2.	User Photographs<br>a.	NHS CRS to provide a real-time mechanism for ESR to store and retrieve User photographs.<br>b.	Storage should be sufficient to hold, in addition to NHS CRS volumes, an annual average of 900,000 ESR-only photographs,
                        each of which should not exceed 50KB (Kilobytes) in size.  The annual average comprises 50% of ESR's non-NHS CRS population
                        and the 300,000 photographs that require temporary storage.<br>c.	NHS CRS should provide a mechanism to ensure that each photograph is suitable for the purpose of identifying the corresponding
                        User and a mechanism to ensure that the size of each photograph does not exceed the limit specified in b, above.<br>d.	User photographs to be managed in accordance with 1, above, User Details Management.<br>e.

BT Use the document, ESR_RA System Requirements Specification as supporting documentation for requirements elaboration<br>b.	BT to agree requirements with the Authority<br>c.	BT to evaluate solution options, based on jointly agreed criteria<br>d.	BT to engage vendors commercially for pricing, support and maintenance<br>e.	BT to source candidate solution for evaluation and potential demonstration <br>f.	BT respond to this CCN<br>g.	Upon Authority selection and CCN approval, BT to deliver the solution

                        such as housing estates or business parks within already densely populated inner city areas leads to 'Postcode exhaustion'
                        where we have no free Postcodes to allocate.  However, due to the geographical nature of the Postcode system the wider area
                        is considered and new Postcode sectors and Postcodes are allocated. This may also apply in the cases of demolished buildings.<br><br>There is a changeover period of 12 months allowed by the Royal Mail, where both old and postcodes are valid.<br><br>The Royal Mail produces a 6-monthly summary of changes known as a Postcode Update which are published to the internet. <br><br>http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/jump2?catId=400084 and mediaId=600127<br><br>The Postcode Update File (PUF) contains postcode, locality and thoroughfare update. Postcode updates may involve either changing

This has been elaborated as follows:<br><br>1.	A facility is required to allow Service to update PDS based on the contents of a PUF.<br><br>2.	Addresses in PDS with a postcode matching a changed postcode should have their postcode changed to the new postcode.<br><br>3.	Addresses in PDS with a postcode matching a split postcode should have their postcode changed to the new postcode if the
                        delivery point details provided in the PUF can be unambiguously matched with the PDS address.<br><br>4.	PUF postcodes changes should be performed using standard PDS update processing and should generate Demographic Notifications.

                        26 November 2007. Please refer to StarTeam for the most up-to-date information as this document may have been superceded.<br><br> Description of change: <br><br>a)	Remove the requirement in Schedule 1.2 to monitor and report Spine SLAs by Cluster. <br><br>b)	BT to provide monthly Spine performance reports by business function (i.e. message response times by Message Type separately
                        for PDS, ETP, C and B, GP-GP etc). <br><br>Reason for change:<br>1.	 Background: Schedule 1.2 of the BT Spine contract details a requirement to monitor and report SLAs nationally (i.e. across
                        the whole service/user base) and also separately for the original 5 NPfIT Clusters (i.e. service provided to organisations
                        within each Cluster). Service Points for any SLA failure are primarily attributable to national failures, but should this
                        SLA be achieved then 20% of the service points are applied to SLA failures for each Cluster. In practice, this breakdown of
                        SLA/Points reporting does not apply to availability targets or to SLAs for QMAS and SUS, and primarily affects SLAs for message
                        response times and help desk call pick-up targets.<br><br>2.	This approach is now outdated and needs changing for the following reasons: -<br><br>a)	The NPfIT no longer has 5 Clusters but is divided into 3 Programmes and 10 SHAs.<br><br>b)	A number of users/data submitters to the Spine sit outside the core NHS family and are not directly responsible/linked
                        to an SHA (or NPfIT Programme), e.g. Pharmacies, MoD services national ?back-office? services; this data and associated SLAs
                        are excluded from any Cluster (or SHA/Programme) analysis and report, although included in national SLAs.<br><br>c)	Some suppliers (e.g. CSC, TPP, Isoft) are moving away from individual End Points to a central End Point (data-centre) from
                        which messages for several NHS organisations are sent to Spine; the central End Point does not relate solely to one NHS user
                        or SHA-linked group of users. This approach significantly affects BTs? ability to accurately map the originator of the message
                        to meaningful NHS/NPfIT geographical areas for SLA reporting.<br><br>3.	In addition, we are receiving an increasing number of requests to report on Spine performance by business function (i.e.
                        response times for ETP, C and B, GP-GP, PDS), and we do not currently receive routine reports in this format from BT to support
                        these requests. <br><br>Consequence of no change: <br>1. An element of Spine SLA reporting becomes naturally obsolete and of little relevance to the business supported by this
                        Programme.<br>2.  The Authority will not receive data to support the increasing number of requests for information about the performance
                        of business functions of Spine services.

                        records, for example from waiting lists or hospital transport. It has excellent sponsorship and usage within the user community.<br>The report was included in the 2008-B release, but was reduced in scope due to the time-boxed nature of the design phase.
                        This CCN is to introduce an amendment to the report into R16 Phase 1. The nature of the change is to allow a user to additionally
                        select a single organisation and to report on those patients that are deceased and have been traced by that organisation.

                        have been superceded. Please refer to StarTeam for up-to-date information.<br><br>The SUD application must be updated as part of this CCN:<br>1.	The new URP Template 'closed date' attribute should be handled by SUD when determining which Templates are available. However,
                        SUD is not required to have the functionality to 'close' a template using this attribute.<br>2.	When a Person entry is 'locked' by ESR (a new attribute on Person), SUD must not make changes to that Person, or child
                        OrgPerson or URP entries. This status should also be displayed when an RA views a Person or OrgPerson.<br>3.	Validation on some Person/OrgPerson/URP attributes will change, such as relaxing the requirement that a Person email address
                        ends in @nhs.net. Most of these changes will be when an RA manages a Person or OrgPerson.<br>4.	Other minor changes to the processing logic may be required to handle new/changed attributes as per the information view
                        below.<br><br>There are no functional changes needed to the OMS application. This approach has been agreed with the customer.<br>There are no functional changes needed to the RA Reporting component. This approach has been agreed with the customer.<br>The consistency checker will require some minor updates to properly check the consistency of the updated attributes.

                        as per Information Governance policy defined for Spine audit and alerting. Hence the quality of information provided by ERS
                        reports is a business requirement under "The Care Record Guarantee" audit compliance.<br>Background<br>ERS provides a mechanism for non-real time reporting of the Subject Access Reports. It provides "The Care Record Guarantee"
                        facility whereby a patient can legally ask to see a report showing when and by whom their sensitive personal data was output
                        (i.e., displayed or printed) during a specified period. NHS CFH has raised concerns with audit data included in the current
                        ERS SAR reports. The ERS reports shows audit compliance issues with respect to audit data logging and reporting.  <br>A number of issues have been identified with the current ERS audit reports which require immediate attention. The CCNs 1770
                        and 1782 addresses what must be done in the short term to ensure NHS CFH can continue to honour the Care Record Guarantee
                        whilst the Information Governance team take a long-term view of the requirements around audit and alerting. This CCN 1782
                        is aimed at have monitoring and control mechanism in place for these compliance issues.<br>Exclusions<br>Specifically excluded from the scope of this AAF is any effort required to fix identified issues.<br>Proposed Approach<br>It is proposed to implement the CCN in two phases. Phase-1 (1770) will include high priority items delivery aligned with the
                        8-B ERS release. Phase-2 (1782) will include all other remaining complex items to be delivered in the post 8-B ERS release.
                        The later CCN 1782 for phase-2 will impact previously delivered phase-1 functionality for CCN 1770.
